# Hey! Listen!
### This project is *super old* and is on Github mainly for entertainment value.

**touch.js** was my *learn all about iOS touch events* project. I was about to do a mobile-only (pre-responsive-design) site for my client, and wanted to get a handle on touch events and CSS3 stuff on iOS. I had grand plans for a iOS-friendly site for a friend that never really materialised, but hey, the learning part was fun. I enjoyed messing around with [XUI](http://github.com/xui/xui) as well.

Apparently (according to the contents of `.git/vendor/`) I was messing with a git GUI called [gity](https://web.archive.org/web/20110128222009/http://gityapp.com/), which is no longer maintained. RIP gity.

The repository is committed as is. For some reason there are some random PNGs and PSDs in there. Save-as misfires, if I recall correctly.
